If you don't like fiddling with wires to make your teleporter network then this mod is for you. 
Just place a server, and connect couple of wireless teleporters to it and teleport away.

Mod adds multiple types of teleporter servers (2 to 10 capacity) and 
wireless teleporter with range of 1/4 of the map and items to build them either by buying or drops from bosses.

Mod currently doesn't support multiplayer
